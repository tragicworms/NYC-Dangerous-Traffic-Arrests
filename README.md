# NYC-Dangerous-Traffic-Arrests
This is my second project for the LaGuardia Data Analytics Python course, DATA201: an analysis of NYPD historical arrest data in the 5 boroughs of NYC dating back to 2006.

The dataset used is far too large to be uploaded to this repository (5M+ rows). It can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u).
